and an Executive Overview.***






*Ever wondered how data can help a company recover

from major business losses? That’s the story behind 

Business Insights 360, my Power BI project for AtliQ

Hardwares designed to turn raw data into powerful business insights.*






**🔍 The Challenge:**
*AtliQ Hardwares faced a major business setback in Latin America, 

which highlighted the need for smarter, data-driven decisions.

One of the key competitors in this space is Dell Technologies, a 

global leader in PCs, servers and IT infrastructure. AtliQ’s

strategy must account for such established players who have scale,

service breadth and global reach which raises the bar for AtliQ’s 

analytics and decision-making capabilities.

I took on the challenge to transform their data into meaningful insights that drive growth.*
